In the 'utils' directory, you can find a tool using libany2uni. It is called
'any2utf8' It reads a document and outputs the text in UTF8, to the standard
output.
To compile it, just type make.
Run it with './any2utf8 <path + name of the document>'.
You can also get metadata with the -m option.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, especially in writing new plugins for more document formats (OASIS OpenDocuments, ...). Please contact lab@elikya.com if you wish to develop a plugin to avoid duplicate work. Thank you.
