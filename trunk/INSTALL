Requirements:
-------------
In order to compile the library, you need to have the followings installed:
	-> ICU 2.1-2
	-> libexpat 1.95.8-1
	-> zlib

If you want to generate the documentation, you will also need Doxygen.

First, unpack the sources:
	gunzip [filename.tar.gz]
	tar-xvf [filename.tar]
Go into src directory:
	cd libany2uni/src
Enter root user mode.
Then, compile and install:
	make
	make install
If you want to remove junk:
	make clean
To remove all generated files:
	make distclean
	(this won't delete files installed in /usr/lib/)
