HOW TO INSTALL THE ANY2UNI LIBRARY
----------------------------------


Requirements:
-------------
In order to compile the library, you need to have the followings installed:
	-> ICU 2.1-2 or ICU 3.4
	-> libexpat 1.95.8-1
	-> zlib

If you want to generate the documentation, you will also need Doxygen.


INSTALLATION:
-------------
First, unpack the sources:
	gunzip [filename.tar.gz]
	tar-xvf [filename.tar]
Go into src directory:
	cd libany2uni/src
Enter root user mode.
Then, compile and install:
	make
	make install
By default, the library is installed in /usr/local. You can give another
install directory with the argument 'prefix=<your_directory>' after 'make'
and 'make install'.

If you want to remove junk:
	make clean
To remove all generated files:
	make distclean
	(this won't delete installed files)


DOCUMENTATION:
--------------
To generate documentation, go to libany2uni directory and type:
	doxygen doxyconf


USING THE LIBRARY:
------------------
To use the library, all you need to do is to include
<libany2uni/userInterface.h>. You have to compile using the
-lany2uni option. (check that your install directory is set
in /etc/ld.so.conf).
